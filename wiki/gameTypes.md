# Turn Based Games

Turn based games play differently to real time games. The game does not run in real time, however runs in tick intervals.

When all players are ready, a given number of ticks (based on game settings) will happen all at once. This means that games can be played much much faster than real time games or allow players who do not have enough time to monitor real time games to play competitively.

Like in real time games, turn based games have an auto-resign function. If a player misses a number of consecutive turns equal to the game’s settings, or doesn’t do anything on the first turn, that player will be automatically resigned.
